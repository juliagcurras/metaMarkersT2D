# metaMarkersT2D

This repository contains the shiny app code to access the results of a meta-analysis
of proteomics studies focused on identifying potential biomarkers for type 2 
diabetes (T2D). 

* PROSPERO protocol: [CRD42025648346](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42025648346)

Clone the repository to run the app locally, or access it directly at the following 
link: [https://jgcurras.shinyapps.io/metaMarkersT2D/](https://jgcurras.shinyapps.io/metaMarkersT2D/). 


## App usage

### User interface

General overview:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/UIStructure.png")
```


### Selection panel

This user-friendly app features a left panel where the [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) protein ID of 
interest must be entered. If the protein is not found in the database (i.e., it 
is not present in any of the 27 final studies included in the meta-analysis), a 
warning, red box will appear in this panel. If no warning is shown, users can 
apply additional filters (such as sample type, data acquisition mode, statistical 
test, or country) to refine the reported studies. Then, by clicking the 
_START SEARCH!_ button, the search results will be displayed in the right and 
bottom panels.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/Selection.png")
```


### Top-right panel: results (I)

Once the _START SEARCH!_ button is clicked, several outputs are generated. The 
top-right panel displays three tables with basic information about the articles 
in which the input protein was found, including relevant details on study design,
article metadata, and proteomic data. These tables are located in separate
overlapping tabs; to view each one, simply click on the corresponding tab name. 

#### Relevant information

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rightPanel_Relevant.png")
```

#### Article description

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rightPanel_Article.png")
```

#### Proteomic data

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rightPanel_Proteomics.png")
```


### Bottom panel: results (II)

The most important output of this app is displayed in this panel. First, a bar 
plot shows all the studies in which the protein was found, with bars representing 
the **magnitude and direction of the logâ‚‚ fold change (logFC)**. The bars are 
color-coded based on the **significance of the protein in each study**, taking into 
account whether p-values or adjusted p-values were used as the significance metric.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/bottomPanelGraph.png")
```

The same information is also presented in a table, with articles listed in rows 
and specific values for FC, logFC, p-values, adjusted p-values, and the adjusted 
p-values used in the omics-based meta-analysis (calculated when no adjusted value
was originally provided). 

This table can be copied or downloaded as an _Excel_ or _CSV_ file using the panel 
in the top-left corner. Columns can be sorted, and information can be searched 
using the bar in the top-right corner of the table.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/bottomPanelTab.png")
```



### Contact information

Contact information is provided at the bottom of the webpage, along with a link 
to the GitHub repository where issues can be reported.
